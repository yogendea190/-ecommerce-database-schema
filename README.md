📚 E-commerce Order Management System – SQL Schema Design

This project defines the database schema for an E-commerce Order Management System. The schema supports essential operations such as customer management, orders, payments, shipments, products, and wishlists.

📌 Overview

This project is part of my SQL Developer Internship task. I designed a relational database schema for a E-commerce Order Management System using MySQL.

🧱 Tables Created

The system includes the following entities:

- **Customer**: Stores registered customers.
- **Category**: Defines product categories.
- **Product**: Manages product details, pricing, and stock.
- **Order**: Tracks customer orders.
- **Order_Item**: Represents individual products within an order.
- **Payment**: Records payment information linked to orders.
- **Shipment**: Captures shipping details for orders.

All tables are defined with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and default values to ensure data integrity and consistency.
